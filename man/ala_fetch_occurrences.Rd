\usage{
ala_fetch_occurrences(
  taxa,
  min_year = NULL,
  boundary = NULL,
  boundary_simplify = NULL,
  columns = ala_default_occurrence_fields(),
  fetch_fun = NULL,
  config = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa}{Tibble with resolved species metadata.}

\item{min_year}{Optional numeric year; if supplied, filters records to events
on or after this year.}

\item{boundary}{Optional spatial boundary (path to a vector file or \code{sf}
object) used to restrict the query. When provided, the resulting polygon is
passed via \code{galah::galah_polygon()}.}

\item{boundary_simplify}{Optional numeric tolerance (in boundary CRS units)
applied when simplifying the boundary geometry.}

\item{columns}{Character vector of occurrence fields to request.}

\item{fetch_fun}{Optional function overriding the download implementation.
Defaults to an internal wrapper around \code{galah} and exists mostly for
testing.}

\item{config}{Optional list of galah configuration values (e.g., email).
Passed through to \code{galah::galah_config()} when using the default
implementation.}
}
\value{
A tibble of occurrence records with species metadata attached.
}
\description{
Fetches occurrence records from the Atlas of Living Australia for the
species produced by \code{\link[=ala_resolve_species]{ala_resolve_species()}}.
